# Quick Start Guide

> **Repository:** [github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM)

> For the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, please refer to the documentation shipped with the DriveOS release 

This quick start guide will get you up and running with TensorRT Edge-LLM in ~15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson Thor
- JetPack 7.1
- Internet connection for downloading models
- x86 Linux host with GPU for model export

## Step 1: Clone Repository (on both x86 host and device)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM.git
cd TensorRT-Edge-LLM
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Step 2: Install Python Package (on x86 host)

```bash
# Install Python package with all dependencies
pip3 install .
```

This installs the Python export tools and all required dependencies.

## Step 3: Build C++ Project (on device)

Ensure that CUDA and TensorRT is installed via Jetpack. TensorRT should be installed in `/usr` folder.

```bash
# Install system build tools if needed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake build-essential

# Build the project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DTRT_PACKAGE_DIR=/usr \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/aarch64_linux_toolchain.cmake \
    -DEMBEDDED_TARGET=jetson-thor
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Note**: Both the toolchain file and embedded target are required for all Edge device builds.

This will build:
- C++ engine builder applications
- C++ runtime and examples

## Step 4: Download and Export a Model (on x86 host)

Let's use [Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) as a lightweight example:

```bash
# Quantize to FP8 (downloads model automatically)
tensorrt-edgellm-quantize-llm \
    --model_dir Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --output_dir ./quantized/qwen3-0.6b \
    --quantization fp8

# Export to ONNX
tensorrt-edgellm-export-llm \
    --model_dir ./quantized/qwen3-0.6b \
    --output_dir ./onnx_models/qwen3-0.6b
```

## Step 5: Build TensorRT Engine (on Thor device)

Transfer the entire ONNX folder to your Thor device, then:

```bash
./build/examples/llm/llm_build \
    --onnxDir ./onnx_models/qwen3-0.6b \
    --engineDir ./engines/qwen3-0.6b
```

Build time: ~2-5 minutes

## Step 6: Run Inference

Create an input file `input.json` with your prompts:

```json
{
    "batch_size": 1,
    "temperature": 1.0,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "top_k": 50,
    "max_generate_length": 128,
    "requests": [
        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is the capital of United States?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Then run inference:

```bash
./build/examples/llm/llm_inference \
    --engineDir ./engines/qwen3-0.6b \
    --inputFile input.json \
    --outputFile output.json
```

**Input Format:** Our format matches closely with the OpenAI API format. Please see `examples/llm/INPUT_FORMAT.md` for more details. Some example input files are available in `tests/test_cases/` (for example, `llm_basic.json`).

**Success!** 🎉 Check `output.json` for model responses.
