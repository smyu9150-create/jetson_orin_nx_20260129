# TensorRT Plugins Guide

This documentation explains the usage of TensorRT plugins with TensorRT Edge-LLM and guides users to make further customizations.

## Overview

TensorRT plugins are custom operations that extend the functionality of the TensorRT core library through user-defined layer implementations. Within the TensorRT Edge-LLM framework, plugins provide specialized implementations for key large language model (LLM) inference operations that require optimizations beyond those available through standard TensorRT library deliverables.

### Plugin Architecture and Capabilities

TensorRT plugins are user-defined layers that implement the `IPluginV2DynamicExt` interface, providing the following capabilities:

- **Feature Extension**: Extend functionality of existing TensorRT versions with new runtime and kernel level optimizations.
- **Modular Encapsulation**: Package complex computational logic into reusable components with configurable parameters.

### Current plugins

1. **AttentionPlugin**: Implements standard MHA (Multi-Head Attention) and GQA (Group Query Attention).
2. **Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin**: Implements Int4 weights-only groupwise GEMM and GEMV.

## AttentionPlugin

**Functional Description**: 
- Handles Rotary positional encoding, KVCache I/O, and MHA/GQA attention computation. 
- Implements FP16 precision and covers all supported SMs of TensorRT Edge-LLM.
- Supports prefill (normal and chunked) stage causal attention.
- Supports vanilla decoding attention and tree decoding attention that is used by EAGLE speculative decoding.
- Supports linear KVCache with equal capacity within one batch.
- Pads to maximum input sequence length within the batch for prefill execution.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `num_q_heads`: Integer specification of query attention head count
- `num_kv_heads`: Integer specification of key-value head count (enables MQA/GQA configurations)
- `head_size`: Integer specification of per-head dimension size
- `enable_tree_attention`: Boolean flag to enable tree attention for speculative decoding implementations

**Input Tensors**:
- `PackedQKV`: Packed tensors from attention Q/K/V projections with layout `[B, S, H, D]`
- `KVCache`: KVCache tensor with layout `[B, 2, H, S, D]` where `S` is the KVCache capacity for each sequence
- `ContextLengths`: Describes the length of sequence for each batch.
- `RopeCosSin`: Pre-computed RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) cosine/sine cache to apply positional encoding.
- `KVCacheStartIndex`: Describes the KVCache start index when conducting chunked prefill.
- `AttentionMask`: (Optional) Bitwise input to describe the attention schema of a speculative draft tree.
- `AttentionPosIds`: (Optional) Describes the location of the draft tree token within the sequence.

**Output Tensors**:
- `AttentionOutput`: Result of the attention computation.
- `KVCache`: Output KVCache tensor (same address as input KVCache tensor).


**Application Domains**:
- Transformer-based autoregressive language models that adopt standard MHA/GQA.

### Kernel Sources

Attention kernels are compiled into CUDA binaries. We provide the methods to produce CUDA binaries in `kernelSrcs/`. 

**Kernel Libraries**:
- `fmha_v2`: Performant context phase attention kernels developed by NVIDIA. Please refer to the original code repository for additional context and extension guidance.
- `xqa`: Performant decoding attention kernels developed by NVIDIA. Implements normal decoding and tree-attention decoding.


### Integration Workflow

The AttentionPlugin integrates into the TensorRT Edge-LLM inference pipeline through the following stages:

1. **Export Phase**: During ONNX model export, attention operations are annotated for plugin-based implementation through the Python export pipeline.
2. **Engine Construction**: The TensorRT engine builder identifies plugin operations via registered plugin creators and integrates them into the optimized computation graph.
3. **Runtime Execution**: During inference, the AttentionPlugin executes as a node within the TensorRT engine's execution graph, with memory management handled by the TensorRT runtime.

## Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin

**Functional Description**
- Implement A([M, K]) x B([K, N]) GEMM semantic where A is activation input, B is weights input.
- Supports INT4 weights-only groupwise quantization GEMM.
- Supports group size of 128.
- Accumulation is performed in FP16 precision for both GEMM and GEMV kernels.
- Implements symmetric quantization schema and zero-points is not supported.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `N`: Output feature dimensions of the GEMM operation
- `K`: Inner dimensions of the GEMM operation
- `GroupSize`: Number of INT4 weight items corresponding to one scaling factor (currently supports 128 only)

**Input Tensors**:
- `GEMMInput`: Input activation tensor for the GEMM computation.
- `Int4Weights`: Swizzled INT4 weights that are packed into INT8 datatypes.
- `ScalingFactors`: Groupwise scaling factors.

**Output Tensors**:
- `GEMMOutput`: Result of the INT4 groupwise GEMM computation.

### Kernel Sources

A simplified kernel implementation is provided for this plugin. Evaluation indicates that this INT4 GEMM kernel achieves performance comparable to CUTLASS implementations on target production platforms (primarily Orin SKUs) with input sequence lengths (ISLs) of 2K to 3K tokens. Note that the GEMM kernel may not deliver sufficient performance for speculative decoding use cases with draft tree sizes of 64 to 128 tokens.

### Integration Workflow

The Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin integrates into the TensorRT Edge-LLM inference pipeline through the following stages:

1. **Quantization Phase**: During model quantization, linear layers are converted to INT4 weights-only quantization format using the groupwise quantization scheme (group size of 128).
2. **Export Phase**: During ONNX model export, quantized matrix multiplication operations are annotated for Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin implementation through the Python export pipeline.
3. **Engine Construction**: The TensorRT engine builder identifies Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin operations via registered plugin creators and integrates them into the optimized computation graph.
4. **Runtime Execution**: During inference, the Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin executes quantized GEMM/GEMV operations as nodes within the TensorRT engine's execution graph.
